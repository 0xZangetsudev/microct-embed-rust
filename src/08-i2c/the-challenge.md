# The challenge

The challenge for this chapter is, to build a small application that
communicates with the outside world via the serial interface introduced
in the last chapter. It should be able to receive the commands "magnetometer"
as well as "accelerometer" and then print the corresponding sensor data
in response. This time no template code will be provided since all you need
(apart from the magnetometer API which you will have to look up in the documentation)
is already provided in the UART and this chapter.
