# `Discovery`

Discover the world of microcontrollers through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)!

There are currently two versions of this book. The first is older and uses an
F3 Discovery circuit board to introduce you to microcontrollers and Rust, while
the second is newer and uses a micro:bit circuit board instead.

- [Read the newer book, using a micro:bit](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit)
- [Read the older book, using an F3 discovery board](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery)
- Start working on the examples from this repository
- You've got questions?
    - Have a look at our [discussions section on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/discussions)
    - Maybe it has already been answered
    - If not, start a new discussion
- You've found an issue?
    - Have a look at our [issues on
      GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues)
    - Maybe there is already a workaround
    - If not, please open a new one - or even better - a [pull
      request](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pulls) for solving
      it
- Have fun and enjoy!

=======
- Teaching Rust. There's plenty of material on that topic already. We'll focus on microcontrollers
  and embedded systems.

- Being a comprehensive text about electric circuit theory or electronics. We'll just cover the
  minimum required to understand how some devices work.

- Covering details such as linker scripts and the boot process. For example, we'll use existing tools
  to help get your code onto your board, but not go into detail about how those tools work.

Also I don't intend to port this material to other development boards; this book will make exclusive
use of the micro:bit development board.

Many thanks to [integer 32](http://integer32.com/) for sponsoring me to work on this book! Please
give them lots of work (they do Rust consulting!) so they'll have no choice but to hire more
Rustaceans <3.
